CSS Basics

#Syntax is very different from HTML

#CSS is a set of rules which contain a 'selector' 
	and one or more 'proprty' with a 'value' with
		punctuation.

Example - body{
				font-family:ariel,sans-serif;
	

				}


		Here, Body is a selector
				font-fam is a property
					ariel is a value


-->How to use CCS with HTML
		
		There are three ways,

		1. Inline - right on HTML tag - using the
						style=attriute

		2. An embedded style sheat in head of document.

		3. As external sheet style in seperate document.
